CN,,,State Council,SC,NPC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The State Council is the top administrative body of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), the state founded and ruled by the CCP, and it effectively functions as the national cabinet of the central government. The main difference with other countries is that the State Council oversees the implementation of policies decided by the CCP, rather than formulating its own national policy agenda. However, the State Council has oversight of key economic agencies, and its implementation role can enable meaningful policy influence through interpreting central directives, drafting laws and regulations, issuing administrative regulations, and formulating development plans and government budgets. The State Council is led by the Premier, who is assisted by four Vice Premiers and five State Councilors (including the State Council Secretary-General), who together form the State Council executive, which meets two to three times a month to discuss major government work and draft laws and regulations. The Premier and an Executive Vice Premier sit on the PSC, and the three other Vice Premiers hold Politburo seats. A plenary meeting of the full State Council is held every six months. It includes the leaders of all its constituent departments, which currently comprise 24 ministries and commissions, the People’s Bank of China, and the National Audit Office. The PRC President nominates the Premier, who is then approved by the National People’s Congress (NPC) at the Two Sessions following a Party Congress, for a maximum of two five-year terms. The Premier then nominates the rest of the State Council, whose members are appointed by the President following NPC approval. Despite such procedures, these appointments are decided by top leaders in secret negotiations. A major political project of Xi’s rule has been to erode the institutional influence of the Premier and the State Council, which had traditionally played a leading role in economic policymaking, especially under Premiers Zhu Rongji (1998–2003) and Wen Jiabao (2003–2013).

 

The State Council also oversees economic research organizations. The State Council Development Research Center (DRC) is a ministerial-level public institution that researches a wide range of domestic and international economic issues and advises both the State Council and CCP Central Committee on economic policies. Its influence has declined, however, in line with Xi’s steady marginalization of the broader State Council. The State Council Counselors’ Office is a deputy ministerial-level agency that provides research and feedback on government policies, including but not limited to the economy, although it has less influence than the DRC."

It is currently composed of 205 full members and 171 alternate members (see list). Members are nominally elected once every five years by the National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party. In practice, the selection process is done privately, usually through consultation of the CCP's Politburo and its corresponding Standing Committee.[1]

The Central Committee is, formally, the ""party's highest organ of authority"" when the National Congress is not in a plenary session. According to the CCP's constitution, the Central Committee is vested with the power to elect the General Secretary and the members of the Politburo and its Standing Committee, as well as the Central Military Commission. It endorses the composition of the Secretariat and the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection. It also oversees the work of various executive national organs of the CCP. The administrative activities of the Central Committee are carried out by the Central Committee's General Office. The General Office forms the support staff of the central organs that work on the Central Committee's behalf in between plenary sessions (plenums).

The Committee usually convenes at least once a year at a plenum, and functions as a top forum for discussion about relevant policy issues. The committee operates, however, on the principle of democratic centralism; i.e., once a decision is made, the entire body speaks with one voice. The role of the Central Committee has varied throughout history. While it generally exercises power through formal procedures defined in the party constitution, the ability for it to affect outcomes of national-level personnel decisions is limited, as that function has generally been, in practice, carried out by the Politburo and retired party elders who retain influence. Nonetheless, Central Committee plenums function as venues whereby policy is discussed, fine-tuned, and publicly released in the form of ""resolutions"" or ""decisions""."

Its members advise and put proposals for political and social issues to government bodies. However, the CPPCC is a body without real legislative power. While consultation does take place, it is supervised and directed by the CCP.

The organizational hierarchy of the CPPCC consists of a National Committee and regional committees. Regional committees extend to the provincial, prefecture, and county level. According to the charter of the CPPCC, the relationship between the National Committee and the regional committees is one of guidance and not direct leadership. However, an indirect leadership exists via the United Front Work Department at each level. The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference typically holds a yearly meeting at the same time as plenary sessions of the National People's Congress (NPC). The CPPCC National Committee and NPC plenary sessions are collectively called the Two Sessions.

The body traditionally consists of delegates from the CCP and its people's organizations, eight legally permitted political parties subservient to the CCP, as well as nominally independent members. The CPPCC National Committee is chaired by a member of the Politburo Standing Committee of the CCP, who is assisted by several vice chairs and a secretary-general. The CPPCC is intended to be more representative of a broader range of people than is typical of government office in the People's Republic of China, including a broad range of people from both inside and outside the CCP. The composition of the members of the CPPCC changes over time according to national strategic priorities."
CN,中共中央全面深化改革委员会,,CCP Central Comprehensively Deepening Reforms Commission,CCDRC,CCP,(outdated - last post September 2022),http://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/64162/448539/index.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The CCP Central Comprehensively Deepening Reforms Commission (CCDRC) is arguably the country’s most influential policymaking, coordination, and implementation body, as it is the institution that Party leader Xi Jinping uses more than any other to implement top-level policy changes to the economic system (see “Economy and Trade” and other sections). The CCDRC has discussed several policy documents related to the science and technology system, including reforms to research evaluation mechanisms and innovation progress indicators and programs to focus on key technologies, promote research commercialization, incentivize talent, improve talent, and reduce waste. Xi is the CCDRC Director, and the Premier, Chairman of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, and CCP Secretariat First Secretary have served as Deputy Directors. The CCDRC’s current membership is unclear, but it is thought to include around 20 deputy national-level leaders.

The party announced the establishment of the Central Comprehensively Deepening Reforms Leading Group at the Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee in November 2013, and Xi chaired its first meeting in January 2014. The party upgraded this leading group to a formal commission in the party-state reforms of March 2018. Xi has used the CCDRC more than any other institution to implement “top-level design” and centralize policy decision-making across dozens of lower-level party agencies and state ministries. It meets about seven times annually to discuss reforms in six policy areas: the economic system and ecological civilization, democracy and the legal system, the cultural system, the social system, the party-building system, and the discipline and inspection system. A CCDRC “special group,” headed by a ministerial-level official, leads the commission’s detailed policy work in each area. The CCDRC focuses on far more than just economic policy, but it has played a key role in Xi’s efforts to reform the Chinese economic system with respect to markets, state-owned enterprises, technological innovation, high-end manufacturing, and environmental sustainability. Xi is the CCDRC Director, and the Premier, the Chairman of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), and the CCP Secretariat First Secretary have served as Deputy Directors. The CCDRC’s current membership is unclear, but it is thought to include around 20 deputy national-level leaders from the Politburo, State Council, and CPPCC."

Formed in January 2017, the body replaced several leading groups with a similar focus. At the CMCFDC’s first meeting in June 2017, Xi emphasized the importance of technological innovation in making China a “self-reliant” great power. Xi serves as the CMCFDC Director, and the Premier, CCP Secretariat First Secretary, and Executive Vice Premier serve as Deputy Directors, a leadership lineup that significantly elevated the political priority of dual-use technology compared with previous leading groups. The Executive Vice Premier also heads the CMCFDC General Office, assisted by a ministerial-level Executive Deputy Director who runs day-to-day policy operations. Important institutions in military-civil fusion include several defense-related central state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and the Central Military Commission’s Equipment Development Department (which houses the China Manned Space Agency) and Science and Technology Committee, both of which were founded following Xi’s sweeping military reforms in 2015 (see “Military” section for more details.)"

The CAC has emerged as an unusually prominent policy actor, compared with the General Offices of other central party commissions, because it simultaneously functions under both the CCP Central Committee and the State Council as the country’s chief internet regulator. Its original remit to manage online content and enforce online censorship has been expanded to include rulemaking and punishment powers over cybersecurity (including network equipment and security reviews), data security (including the export of important data), and online privacy (including the export of personal information). The CAC usually plays the leading role in Beijing’s regulatory response to emerging online technologies, such as AI chatbots, deepfakes, livestreaming, and recommendation algorithms. These changes have transformed the CAC into a super-regulator with potential jurisdiction over virtually all online activity. The most infamous display of its formidable powers came in mid-2021, when the CAC investigated the initial public offering (IPO) of rideshare giant DiDi on the New York Stock Exchange, retroactively declaring the need for a (now mandatory) cybersecurity review, during which time it blocked the app and suspended new registrations. DiDi eventually delisted. The CAC also controls the China Internet Investment Fund, which owns minority stakes, or so-called golden shares, acquired under government pressure from in top Chinese tech firms such as ByteDance and Weibo. The National Radio and Television Administration (NRTA), a ministerial-level agency directly under the State Council that is led by the CCP Propaganda Department, retains oversight of approval for new audiovisual products such as movies and television shows, but the CAC retains the authority to censor such content online. The CAC usually plays the leading role in Beijing’s regulatory response to emerging online technologies, such as AI chatbots, deepfakes, livestreaming, and recommendation algorithms."
CN,中共中央科学技术委员会,,CCP Central Science and Technology Commission,CSTC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The top institution focused specifically on science and technology policymaking is the CCP Central Science and Technology Commission (CSTC), which was announced as part of the party-state institutional reforms of March 2023. The CSTC is intended to strengthen party leadership over science and technology policies and has responsibility for decision-making, discussion, and coordination of work in these areas. More specifically, it is charged with building the national innovation system; reforming the science and technology system; researching major policies for national science and technology development; resolving major strategic and directional issues in the science and technology sphere; determining strategic science and technology missions and major research projects for the national government; coordinating the layout of strategic science and technology forces, including national laboratories; and coordinating the development of civil-military fusion in science and technology. The CSTC General Office resides in the Ministry of Science and Technology, helping to elevate the ministry’s bureaucratic power and political influence.

 

The CSTC gained responsibility for the National Science and Technology Advisory Committee (NSTAC), a secretive group of experts convened by the party in 2019 to advise the top leadership on major national policies, and the National Science and Technology Ethics Committee (NSTEC), another enigmatic expert group established in 2019–2020 to strengthen professional norms, governance mechanisms, institutional supervisions, and the legal and regulatory framework related to scientific ethics. The CSTC also absorbed the former CCP Central Leading Group for the Construction of National Laboratories, National Leading Group for Science and Technology, National Leading Group for Science and Technology System Reform and Innovation System Construction, and National Leading Group for Medium-to-Long-Term Science and Technology Development Planning Work. These changes significantly weakened the State Council’s role in science and technology policy relative to the central party apparatus led by Xi."

MOST was empowered in the March 2023 institutional reforms to focus more on these core missions of vital national interest, shedding its responsibilities for rural science and technology, science and technology for social development, high-tech industrial development, and foreign talent management. MOST administers the deputy ministerial-level National Natural Science Foundation of China, a State Council public institution that allocates over US$5 billion annually to thousands of scientific research projects that advance Beijing’s policy goals, and the deputy ministerial-level Science and Technology Daily, a newspaper focusing on science and technology issues. MOST may not be involved in regulating the technology industry, but it is set to become a more influential player in science and technology policy because it will host the CSTC General Office.

CN,工业和信息化部,,Ministry of Industry and Information Technology ,MIIT,SC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) is a constituent department of the State Council that is a powerful force in China’s technology policy. It is responsible for industrial development; industrial policy; industrial standards; industry operations monitoring; indigenous innovation; information technology; national information security; the development of major equipment industries for manufacturing and transportation; the development of high-tech industries such as biomedicine, new materials, and aerospace; and the management of communications industries such as internet infrastructure, software, telephones, television, radio, airwaves, satellites, and the knowledge economy. In the March 2023 institutional reforms, MIIT acquired new responsibilities for high-tech industry development, local science and technology zones and industrial parks, science and technology service industries and intermediary organizations, and technology markets.

 

MIIT administers the deputy ministerial-level State Administration of Science, Technology, and Industry for National Defense (SASTIND), a State Council bureau that manages the national defense science and technology industries, supervises civil-to-military technology conversion efforts, organizes international cooperation in defense industries, and manages arms exports by military enterprises. It has specific responsibility for the planning and management of the nuclear, aerospace, aviation, shipping, and armament industries, as well as managing the military electronics industry, nuclear power plant construction, isotope production, and the production and circulation of civilian explosives. Many leading cadres in the technology field, including several who became provincial or even national leaders (such as Ma Xingrui and Zhang Guoqing), have worked there. MIIT administers two other deputy ministerial-level State Council bureaus: the China National Space Administration (CNSA), which manages the civilian space industry and international space cooperation, and the China Atomic Energy Authority (CAEA), which manages the nuclear energy industry and international nuclear cooperation.

 

MIIT houses the General Offices of several technology-related State Council policy coordination bodies: the State Leading Group for the Development of the National Integrated Circuit Industry, founded in 2014; the State Leading Group for Building a Manufacturing Power, founded in 2015 to oversee the Made in China 2025 strategy to enhance the country’s dominance of key advanced manufacturing industries; the State Leading Group for the Development of the New Materials Industry, founded in 2016 to manage issues such as nanotechnology and rare earths; and the State Council Leading Group for the Promotion of Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprises, founded in 2009, which has become more relevant as Beijing increasingly focuses on smaller but more specialized technology firms. The latest public records suggest that all these leading groups are headed by the Vice Premier with the industry portfolio, who is currently Zhang Guoqing; the MIIT Minister and others serve as Deputies; and an MIIT Deputy Minister leads the General Office (although this inference is speculative for the last-named group).

 

MIIT oversees the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT), an official think tank that is an influential player in China’s telecommunications and digital economy sectors, including with respect to standards, technical trials, and emerging technologies. It also oversees seven universities that are among China’s leading STEM institutions, including four elite institutions that produce many of China’s leading engineers, scientists, and technologists and are important enough for the CCP’s Organization Department to appoint their party secretaries and presidents: Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (“Beihang”), Beijing Institute of Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, and Northwestern Polytechnical University.

Established by the merger of several regulators in March 2018, the SAMR has emerged as an influential actor in regulatory politics, especially during Xi’s rectification campaign against China’s large platform technology firms, which it leveraged to increase its bureaucratic resources and issue sizeable fines on top companies.

 

SAMR operates several deputy ministerial-level State Council bodies with important regulatory functions in the technology sphere. The Standardization Administration of China (SAC) oversees technical and industrial standardization work and represents China in international standardization bodies (although MIIT interfaces with the United Nations International Telecommunication Union). TC260 is a particularly influential standard-setting body under the SAC and is responsible for standards related to cybersecurity and online personal information protection under Xi’s new cyber-governance regime. The China National Certification and Accreditation Administration (CNCA) is responsible for certification and accreditation related to industrial quality, industrial safety, and public hygiene. The National Medical Products Association (NMPA) regulates, supervises, and formulates standards for medical devices, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals (including those used in Traditional Chinese Medicine).

 

SAMR is a pivotal actor in the implementation and enforcement of the recently amended Anti-Monopoly Law. The National Anti-Monopoly Bureau (NAMB), founded in November 2021, consists of three SAMR departments that investigate and handle administrative monopolies and unfair competition; investigate monopolistic collusion and abuse of market power; and review the concentration of business operators. The NAMB also functions as the General Office of the State Council Anti-Monopoly Commission, which was established in 2008 to coordinate state competition policies and regulatory frameworks, and the National Leading Group for Combating Intellectual Property Infringement and the Production and Sale of Counterfeit and Inferior Goods; both bodies are led by the Vice Premier in charge of market regulation, currently Zhang Guoqing. SAMR also provides guidance to the China Consumers Association, a state-affiliated “social organization” that is often used by the government as a mouthpiece to publicly target both domestic and foreign companies whose business practices create political problems."

CN,国家发展和改革委员会,,National Development and Reform Commission,NDRC,SC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) is arguably the most powerful ministerial-level constituent department of the State Council and plays a pivotal role in coordinating governance matters on both energy and the environment. Formerly the State Planning Commission and the State Development Planning Commission, the NDRC oversees China’s economic development planning process, which at its highest level produces the national Five-Year Plan. The NDRC is the macro-level control department and has responsibility for formulating a broad range of economic and social policies, which often overlap with the mandates of other ministries and agencies. The main functions of the NDRC, and especially its Department of Innovation and High-Tech Development, include promoting innovation-driven development in economic planning and working with other ministries to formulate policies related to innovation, entrepreneurship, industrial upgrading, high-tech industries, strategic emerging industries, and the national layout of science and technology infrastructure. In March 2023, it acquired responsibility for formulating plans for science and technology to promote economic development from the Ministry of Science and Technology. The NDRC is part of the Inter-ministerial Joint Conference for the Digital Economy, together with the Cyberspace Administration of China and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.

 The NDRC is China’s main macroeconomic control institution. It has responsibility for formulating a broad range of economic and social policies, often in conjunction with other line ministries, including Xi’s “common prosperity” agenda. These responsibilities include economic targets, price policies, market policies, supply-side structural reform, overseas investment, domestic investment policy, regional development strategies, industrial development strategies, major infrastructure projects, consumption policy, innovation-driven development, scientific and technological infrastructure, high-tech industries, social development, basic public services, sustainable development, and the social credit system. The NDRC works with the Ministry of Commerce to draft negative lists for foreign investment at the national level and for various special economic zones, and with the National Health Commission to research demographic trends and formulate population policies. The NDRC also manages the General Offices of many leading groups that coordinate policymaking on specific priority issues, giving it added bureaucratic leverage in these areas. These groups include the National Defense Mobilization Committee, State Council Leading Group for Western Development, and State Council Leading Group for the Revitalization of Old Industrial Bases in Northeast China — which are led by the Premier — and the State Council Leading Group for Promoting the Belt and Road Initiative, Leading Group for Coordinated Development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region, Leading Group for Promoting the Development of the Yangtze River Economic Belt, Leading Group for Promoting the Development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, and Leading Group for Promoting Comprehensive Deepening of Reform and Opening in Hainan—which are led by the Executive Vice Premier, usually with the NDRC Chairman as Office Director. The NDRC administers three deputy ministerial-level agencies: the National Food and Strategic Reserves Administration, the National Energy Administration, and the National Data Administration.

The NDRC manages the National Data Administration (NDA), a new deputy ministerial-level State Council bureau announced in the party-state institutional reforms of March 2023. The NDA will oversee building the data infrastructure system; coordinating the integration, sharing, development and utilization of data resources; and overall planning of Digital China, the digital economy, digital social regulation and construction, and similar policy areas. The NDA takes oversight of the economic applications of data from the security-focused Cyberspace Administration of China by acquiring its responsibilities for smart cities, the digitization of public services, cross-department government data sharing, and the development and use of nationally important information. It also takes on the NDRC’s previous responsibilities for the national big data strategy, digital economy, and digital infrastructure. Early conjectures suggest that the NDA will chiefly focus on nurturing the market for data as a “factor of production,” with the consolidation of data oversight under one agency potentially helping to rectify inefficiencies that arose from the fragmentation of regulatory jurisdictions across many agencies and ministries."

CN,农业农村部,,Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs,MARA,SC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (MARA) is a constituent department of the State Council that plays an important role in economic policymaking for China’s rural areas, where almost 35 percent of the Chinese population still lives. Formed as an expansion of the old Ministry of Agriculture in March 2018, MARA is responsible for policies related to the “three rural issues” of China’s development—agriculture (especially agricultural industrialization), rural areas (especially urban-rural economic disparities), and farmers (especially urban-rural income disparities). It manages farming, fisheries, animal husbandry, farmland resources, irrigation projects, land reclamation, agricultural mechanization, agricultural product quality and safety, and agricultural investments. It gained responsibility for policies related to rural science and technology from the Ministry of Science and Technology in March 2023 and absorbed the deputy ministerial-level National Rural Revitalization Administration. Greater attention to rural development reflects Xi’s mission in his second term to end absolute poverty in rural areas and his goal in his third term to narrow the urban-rural divide under his “common prosperity” agenda. MARA also houses the General Office of the CCP Central Rural Work Leading Group (CRWLG), which is led by a Vice Premier, with the MARA Minister as Director and representatives from the ministries and agencies in charge of agriculture, water, forestry, poverty alleviation, and development and reform."

CN,中华全国工商联,,All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce,ACFIC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce (ACFIC) is a nominally nongovernmental chamber of commerce for China’s private entrepreneurs, industrialists, and other business leaders, comprising over 4.5 million members. It functions as an institutional structure for the CCP to contact, consult, and control the private sector. ACFIC is part of the party’s United Front architecture under the CPPCC, which aims to mobilize nonparty personnel and social groups to support the party’s objectives. The federation is a permanent constituent of the CPPCC and is allocated seats in the CPPCC National Committee and the NPC. ACFIC has a ministerial-level Party Secretary and a Chairman, often a member of the China National Democratic Construction Association satellite party, who also serves as deputy national-level CPPCC Vice Chair. A ministerial-level CPPCC Economics Affairs Committee manages political advisory and community consultation work on economic policies. Legislative work on the economy is supervised by the ministerial-level NPC Financial and Economic Affairs Committee, although the most substantive input on new laws comes from party bodies and State Council agencies."
CN,中共中央外事委员会,,CCP Central Foreign Affairs Commission,CFAC,CCP,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The CCP Central Foreign Affairs Commission (CFAC) is the top party institution dedicated to foreign affairs in the Chinese party-state. The party leadership uses the CFAC to make decisions, assign responsibilities, and oversee implementation of a wide variety of foreign-related policies that include traditional diplomacy but also touch on party-to-party diplomacy, external propaganda, foreign trade, overseas intelligence, domestic counterespionage, and the international dimensions of Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan affairs. CFAC meetings are rarely publicized, but the few official readouts that exist show that its membership usually consists of national leaders, including the CCP General Secretary, the Premier, and the Vice President; the Directors of the party’s International Liaison Department and Propaganda Department; the Propaganda Department Deputy who serves as Director of the State Council Information Office; the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, National Defense, Public Security, State Security, and Commerce; and the Heads of party and state agencies responsible for Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, and overseas Chinese.

 

The administrative agency of the CFAC is the Central Foreign Affairs Office (CFAO), which is classified at the ministerial level but is more influential than its ministerial-level rank suggests because it is led by a deputy national-level leader with a Politburo seat. The CFAO is responsible for executing CFAC decisions; coordinating the implementation of CFAC directives; conducting research and making suggestions on international affairs and foreign policy management; drafting and overseeing foreign-related laws and regulations; handling foreign-related inquiries from party, state, and local authorities; and organizing central work on maritime rights and interests. Like the CFAC, the CFAO’s activities are mostly invisible to those outside the system. Since its founding in 2018, the CFAO has been led by a Politburo member who is the country’s top-ranked professional diplomat.

 

The CFAC’s main potential competitor for influence in central decision-making on foreign affairs is the CCP Central National Security Commission (CNSC) that Xi announced in November 2013. Previously, the Central Leading Group for Foreign Affairs functioned simultaneously as the Central Leading Group on National Security, which helps explain the somewhat overlapping responsibilities of the CNSC and the CFAC. For Beijing, national security is a concept that encompasses both international and domestic security, and the CNSC plays a role in shaping China’s foreign policy. There is limited information available about the operation of the CNSC, but it appears that the CNSC plays a leading role in responding to problems or crises that arise in China’s foreign affairs (especially those with a security dimension), while the CFAC focuses on the overall strategy of Chinese foreign policy."

CN,CCP 国际联络部,,CCP International Liaison Department,ILD,CCP,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The other major foreign affairs institution is the ministerial-level CCP International Liaison Department (ILD), which handles the party’s relationships with foreign political parties and other foreign political organizations. Originally, the ILD focused on the party’s relations with foreign communist parties. After the Cold War, however, the number of ruling communist parties dwindled to those in Cambodia, Cuba, Laos, North Korea, and Vietnam. Xi has boosted the ILD’s profile significantly since 2017 by launching a series of high-level summits between the CCP and hundreds of foreign political parties. He wants to forge a “new type of political party relationship” that would see more foreign politicians studying and learning from China’s governance and modernization. The ILD now claims to maintain relations with more than 600 political parties from over 160 countries."
CN,外交部,,Ministry of Foreign Affairs,MOFA,SC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The highest state institution focused on foreign policy is the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA). MOFA handles traditional diplomacy and is often at the center of overseas discussions about China’s international relations, but it is not the most important institution in Chinese foreign policymaking. Like other State Council ministries under Xi’s leadership, MOFA is more of an implementer of policy than a designer of it, especially in an era when “Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy” is the official creed. MOFA has also come under pressure from an increasingly nationalistic Chinese public and polity to assert and defend China’s interests abroad more forcefully. In September 2019, following years of hostile US policy toward China, Xi urged China’s diplomats to show “fighting spirit” and “dare to struggle.” These instructions fed into what became known as “wolf warrior” diplomacy, an assertive and unapologetic approach to defending Beijing’s narratives and criticizing foreign opponents.

 

Since 2018, the Foreign Minister has also served as a State Councilor, an appointment that raises the position from full ministerial rank to deputy national rank, moving from the ranks of the top few hundred leaders to the top few dozen. State Councilors also attend the frequent gatherings of the State Council Executive Meeting, which are chaired by the Premier and include the Vice Premiers, providing the foreign affairs bureaucracy with a greater voice in government decision-making. This move shifted the Foreign Minister’s status closer to its higher standing in the 1990s, when Foreign Minister Qian Qichen served concurrently as a Vice Premier on the Politburo."
CN,国家推进“一带一路”建设领导小组,,State Leading Group for Promoting the Belt and Road Initiative,LGPBRI,SC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The State Council does not have its own coordination body dedicated to foreign affairs, but it does run the State Leading Group for Promoting the Belt and Road Initiative (LGPBRI), Xi’s signature policy to enhance China’s international influence through expanded infrastructure connectivity. The group is likely now led by Executive Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang, who is also a member of the Politburo Standing Committee, but the group’s status as embedded in the state—rather than the party—signals that the initiative is only one of many priorities in Xi’s foreign policy. The fact that many in the group are internally focused Politburo members shows that domestic interests (such as finding external markets to accommodate overcapacity in state-owned enterprises) are significant drivers of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)."
CN,中国国际发展合作署,,China International Development Cooperation Agency,CIDCA,SC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The China International Development Cooperation Agency (CIDCA) is a deputy ministerial-level agency directly under the State Council that was founded in March 2018 to serve as the country’s dedicated foreign aid agency. CIDCA is responsible for foreign aid policy; foreign aid reform; and the planning, negotiation, monitoring, and evaluation of foreign aid projects. The implementation of foreign aid projects remains the responsibility of the various governments departments assigned to these tasks. Its operations are supervised by the Foreign Minister in their capacity as a State Councilor.

 

China’s on-the-ground foreign relations are also shaped by various quasi-governmental or nongovernmental actors, especially the state-owned enterprises and private firms that operate overseas infrastructure projects and produce goods and services that are sold to foreign consumers or into international supply chains. A small number of influential intellectuals in universities, official research institutes, or even independent think tanks also influence foreign policy through their public scholarship, reports written for the leadership, or even official briefings delivered to the Politburo."
CN,中共中央台湾事务领导小组,,CCP Central Taiwan Affairs Leading Group,CTALG,CCP,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The top policy coordination body on cross-Strait relations is the CCP Central Taiwan Affairs Leading Group (CTALG), although Beijing does not consider this part of the foreign affairs system because it sees Taiwan as part of its sovereign territory. The General Secretary chairs the group, reflecting the high importance of Taiwan affairs, but it is notable that since its founding in 1979, the body has not been upgraded to a commission like the CFAC. Other members include the Chairman of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) as Deputy Director; the CFAO Director as Secretary-General; a Vice Premier; a Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission; the Directors of the CCP General Office, Propaganda Department, and United Front Work Department; the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Commerce, and State Security; and the Director of the CTALG’s administrative agency."
CN,国务院台湾事务办公室,,State Council Taiwan Affairs Office,TAO,CTALG,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The State Council Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO), the external name of the CCP Central Taiwan Work Office, is a ministerial-level organ that functions as the administrative agency of the CTALG. It is somewhat more outward facing than most such agencies because it also handles mail, transport, and trade links with Taiwan; preparations for meetings with Taiwanese politicians and officials; Taiwan-related propaganda and political influence work; and a wide range of cultural, economic, and scholarly exchanges between the mainland and Taiwan."
CN,国家能源委员会,,National Energy Commission,NEC,NEC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The National Energy Commission (NEC) is the top agency under the State Council responsible for energy policy. It was founded in 2010, two years after the National Energy Administration (NEA) (please see below), to elevate the political profile of energy strategy and energy security within the Chinese government. The NEC is responsible for formulating energy development strategies, considering major energy security issues, and coordinating both domestic energy development and international energy cooperation. The NEC is a relatively powerful State Council body, as the Premier serves as Chairman, the Executive Vice Premier serves as Vice Chairman, and roughly half of all State Council ministers are members. Its General Office sits in the powerful NDRC, with the NDRC Chairman serving as Director and the NEA Director serving as Deputy Director."
CN,国家能源局,,National Energy Administration,NEA,NDRC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The National Energy Administration (NEA) is a deputy ministerial-level bureau under the State Council that is administered by the NDRC. It reports to both the NDRC and the higher-ranking NEC and is responsible for formulating and implementing laws, regulation, industry plans, reform plans, industrial policies, and standards for the energy industry, plus developing new energy sources and promoting energy conservation. Specific responsibilities include regulating the electric power market and making industrial policy and related standards for coal, oil, natural gas, nuclear power, new energy, renewable energy, energy refining, coal-based fuels, and fuel ethanol. In 2018, the NEA lost the responsibility for everyday management of energy reserves to another NDRC-administered deputy ministerial-level State Council bureau, the newly created National Food and Strategic Reserves Administration."
